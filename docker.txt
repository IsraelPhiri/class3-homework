Docker container is a software that allows one to package of code and 
all it's applications and support tools it needs to run quickly.Compared to VMware, it is more compact because it virtualizes 
soft rather than part of hardware.I would use Docker for group all my 
tools such as Alteryx, PyCharm Editor,Python3 etc. It would be a nice 
one-stop-shop.
